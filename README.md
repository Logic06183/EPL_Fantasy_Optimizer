# EPL_Fantasy_Optimizer
This is a repository for a Python-based web application that allows users to optimize their fantasy football team for the English Premier League. The app uses data from the Fantasy Premier League API to suggest the best team based on user-specified parameters. The app is dockerized and can be easily deployed locally or on a cloud-based platform.
Sure, here's an example README file for the optimizer app:

# EPL Fantasy Football Optimizer

This is a web application that optimizes your fantasy football team for the English Premier League (EPL) using linear programming. Given a budget and the current prices and statistics of all players in the EPL, the app finds the team of 15 players that maximizes your expected total points for the upcoming gameweeks.

## Usage

To use the app, first make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Then, clone this repository and navigate to the root directory. 

Next, install the required packages by running:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the packages, you can run the app locally by executing:

```sh
python app.py
```

This will start the web server and open the app in your default browser. You can then use the app to optimize your fantasy team by selecting your desired budget, position constraints, and expected number of gameweeks.
